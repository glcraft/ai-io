# AIO Configuration File README

Welcome to the configuration file README for our project! This README provides an overview of the configuration file structure and its purpose. The configuration file is written in YAML and is designed to fine-tune the behavior of the engines for specific prompts.

## Introduction

The configuration file allows you to define prompts and their associated settings for interactions with the AI API (Currently only OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model is available). Each engine have a sets of prompts, and each prompt has a set of parameters that can be adjusted to control the output generated by the model.

This document will guide you through setting up your prompts and using the configuration file effectively.

By default, aio will try to read the configuration file from `~/.config/aio/config.yaml`. You can also specify the path to the configuration file using the `--config-path` argument. For example: `aio --config-path ./config.yaml`.

## Usage

### OpenAI 

To use the configuration file effectively, follow these steps:

1. **Defining Prompts**: In the configuration file, you can define different prompts under the `openai.prompts` section. Each prompt consists of a name, a list of system and user messages, and parameters.

2. **Messages**: The whole prompt consists of several messages of three types:
   - "system" messages provide context and instructions to the model, while 
   - "user" messages define the user's input or query.
   - "assisstant" messages are used to mocking the AI response.

    Use the variable `$input` to represent the input from the command line.

3. **Parameters**: Parameters such as temperature, top-p, penalties, and max tokens can be adjusted to control the output generated by the model. You can setup all parameters you want from the [*chat create* OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create).

## Example

Here's a snippet of the configuration file structure:

```yaml
openai:
  prompts:
    - name: command
      messages: 
        # System message for context
        - role: system
          content: In markdown, write the command...
        # User message
        - role: user
          content: $input
      parameters:
        # Parameters to control model behavior
        temperature: 0
        top-p: 1.0 
        frequency-penalty: 0.2
        presence-penalty: 0 
        max-tokens: 200
```

## Sample Prompts

Here are examples of prompt definitions within the sample configuration file you can find in the repository:

1. **Command Prompt**:
   - System Message: Provides instructions for formatting a command.
   - User Message: Represents user input for the command.
   - Parameters: Parameters controlling the response characteristics.

2. **Ask Prompt**:
   - System Message: Provides a brief introduction to ChatGPT.
   - User Message: Represents user input for the query.
   - Parameters: Parameters influencing the model's response.
